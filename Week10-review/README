The <*> It's a sort of a beefed up fmap.
instance Applicative Maybe where
    pure = Just
    Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
    (Just f) <*> something = fmap f something


    ghci> Just (+3) <*> Just 9
    Just 12

By using <$>, the applicative style really shines,
because now if we want to apply a function f between three applicative functors,
we can write f <$> x <*> y <*> z. If the parameters weren't applicative functors but normal values, we'd write f x y z.

<*> Applicative
<$> Functor
