-->There is no String “inside” an IO String
-->   the (>>) operator (pronounced “and then”), which has the type
(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
--> operator (>>=) (pronounced “bind”) with the type
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
--->getLine
main = do
    a <- getLine
    b <- getLine
    c <- getLine
    print [a,b,c]


--> curry and un curry
uncurry converts a curried function to a function on pairs  (a -> b -> c) -> (a,b) -> c
curry 	((a,b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
Input: curry fst 2 3
Output: 2
